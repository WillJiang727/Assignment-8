<div class="bio-text-2">
In June, I started my internship with Deloitte Consulting as a Strategy, Analytics and M&A Intern in Shanghai. Specifically, I worked on site at Godiva and focused on the establishment of CDP,  the development of summer marketing campaigns as well as client’s daily operations. Using SQL, I was able to retrieve data and compute KPIs for our tech team. While the CDP project is still being carried out, I have assisted the team in completing the first few objectives such as data modeling and tagging creation. In addition, I have been in charge of three different campaigns with the goal to call back inactive customers and increase profit margin. By the end of last month, I was able to see a 269% YOY customer growth rate and an ROI of 30% as the result of the campaigns. Lastly, I handled client’s daily operations such as adjustments on the CRM platform, management of the WeChat platform, and customer outreach, all of which dealt with millions of customers. This experience not only enhanced my understanding of what consulting is, but also helped me put my knowledge in marketing and data analytics into practice.
