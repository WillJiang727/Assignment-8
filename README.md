Part 3. Description:
The purpose of this website is to demonstrate my personal projects, interests, and background to potential employers.

I offered information on my background, education and professional experience and interests with my website.

It is interesting and engaging because of the interactive elements of the website. I used bootstrap so that different elements will adjust sizes based on the size of the window and the navigation bar will collapse when the window is small. Besides, I worked a lot on the hovering effect so that the interaction feels smooth and looks great.

The main audience would be potential employers.

Part 4. Using my website:
Hovering effect: move your mouse cursor onto any of the buttons or sections on the page, they will be highlighted or give other kinds of feedback.
Collapsed nav bar: decrease window size until the nav bar collapses into three lines.
Self-adjusting buttons: decrease or increase window size to see how elements react to size change.
Navigate through pages, click on any highlighted element to move around the site between different pages.

Part 5. External libraries: 
Bootstrap: 
Reason to use: to add interactive elements to the design, such as adjustable buttons and collapsible navigation bar.
How: following guidelines on W3Schools and implementing specific classes to achieve the goal of having multiple layers on top of a button to achieve the hovering effect that I was looking for.
It adds a lot of interactivity and accessibility to my website. With bootstrap, my website now supports viewing activity from devices with different screen sizes. In addition, it simply adds fun to browsing the website because it gives smooth and immediate feedback to users when they carry out specific actions.


Part 6. Iteration from HW7: 
To iterate from my HW7 mockups, I asked for feedback on my prototype from my peers and mentors. I used wave to test the accessibility of my prototype. At the same time, I added the scrolling effect to the main page to replace the original idea of drag and drop miniature cars on the main menu. I also decided to use a picture as a background instead of low saturation colors.

Part 7. Major challenges: 
I met a lot of challenges while implementing the website: it is hard to align all three layers for the hovering effect, especially in terms of sizing and positioning. When implementing the collapsible menu, there were a lot of conventions that I did not already know about and had to follow W3Schoolsâ€™ tutorials. Making the corresponding image/ city skyline shadow takes a lot of time since they cannot be simply cropped. I needed to account for different size, opacity and positioning while keeping the layout straight.
